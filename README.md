#Maze solver (Mini Project)

##The project is about building a Maze Solver application using Java language.

##The ME solver is a 2D grid with a starting and ending point, and the goal is to find the shortest possible path between them.

##The grid will have different colored blocks, white blocks represent obstacles, and black blocks are the ones through which the path can go.
